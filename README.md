A simple local password manager app.

Key features:

* Password will be encrypted using AES-256, and keys are generated using Argon2
* All data are saved in a single sqlite3 database file
* Writen by flutter/c++, so it should work in both Android and IOS
* Won't provide any feature for automatically filling form because it's not encouraged to depend on this app too much.
* Support for handwriting/pictures


Currently it's under development and it's in high priority among all my open-source projects~ 

Release plan:

* MVP Dec,2019
